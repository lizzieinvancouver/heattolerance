The viticulture industry is currently faced with the task of adapting to a changing climate.  Phenological timing, largely controlled by temperature, varies by winegrape variety, such that certain varieties may be better suited to produce high quality wine under a warmer climate.  However, there is relatively little phenological data on most varieties of Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera.  We studied budburst and flowering phenology of 50 varieties of winegrape in a greenhouse. We found that the budburst and leafout phenology of greenhouse-grown vines significantly correlates to field observations, but many (28/50) varieties did not flower in the greenhouse.  Of the varieties that formed inflorescences, ten were studied in growth chambers set at different temperatures (20 to 37 Â°C) to assess the rate the vines progressed from inflorescence development through flowering.  While phenological timing was not significantly affected, plants in higher temperature chambers were more likely to abort their flower buds before flowering.  This suggests that one potential outcome of climate change could be lower yields due to abortion of flower buds. Yet our research also highlights the challenges of growing diverse varieties in the greenhouse and suggests more studies on larger vines will be critical for understanding and exploiting variety diversity.
