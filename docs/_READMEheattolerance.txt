Files:
(1) manuscript_revised2.docx is my revision of the text (used manuscript.docx as base, not that manuscript_revised1.docx is NOT the previously submitted version, see below). 
(2) letters/frontiers_responses2.docx
(3) Made new figure (exp4panelchambclim) in chambanalysis.R

What was submitted last?
I downloaded 516527_Merrill_Manuscript.pdf from the Frontiers site and it looks to agree with manuscript.docx. That's my best guess as I have not heard from Nicole and can't tell from GitHub.
