Some notes on the Davis data
Data (analyses/input/budburst_est_2015.csv and leafout_est_2015.csv) created in davisphen_clean.R (vin repo). 

Budburst was considered EL stage 4
Leafout was considered EL stage 7

Each stage was calculated at the level of each individual plant (usually two,  but sometimes more and a few times just one). 

For example, for CabSauv, we just had one plant (I went back to the raw data and checked).

Hereâ€™s the code that takes the average of each variety (by plant):

avgerageplants <- function(datafile, varcolname){
    dat.var <- ddply(datafile, c(varcolname), summarise,
    n = sum(n),
    sd = sd(doy),                   
    doy = mean(doy, na.rm=TRUE))
    dat.var$se <- dat.var$sd/sqrt(dat.var$n)
    return(dat.var)
}

Because Valdepenas and Tempranillo are the same thing I built new R code (rmidat.R) to create output/bblo_2015syn.csv. I also updated the averageplants f(x) to count the number of plants (nplants) in addition to the total dates of observation (n).
