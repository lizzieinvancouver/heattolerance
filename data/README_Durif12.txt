Vars naming

Durif 1 and Durif 2 are the same variety, but have different identification numbers.  The code didn't play well when they had the same "Var", so it was changed.  I guess this brings up the question of what to do with this variety and other varieties that have two names and so are listed separately.  Up until now, if they have a different "Var" name or a different ID number, they have been treated as an entirely separate variety, though this is not always true.
