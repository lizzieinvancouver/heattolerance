Heat tolerance experiment

****************
TO DO:
- Update lit review and send to Inaki and Amber with suggested amplitudes
- Make sure Nicole records: soil moisture, stem length, EL stage, photos of clusters 

Add where we got ripening and table info
- Got data from Adelaide_vars_traits.xlsx
- Also from UniqueVars_Vitis.xlsx (Davis vars work)


****************
Methods:
Cuttings taken from RMI at UC-Davis in December 2015.
Grapevines were dried down and placed into chambers with moist soils on 27 May.
They were then watered again on 13-14 June 2016 (still greenish then) but Kea said they appeared dormant about a week late (should check with her on this).

Notes from chatting with Amber Parker and Inaki today

(Note that some notes went directly into experimental design tex file)
Inaki is away on vacation from 29 July to 29 August

We discussed:
- not doing budburst
- maybe flowering or veraison
- BB-flowering temps that are normal are 20-28; so 25 is okay, but sounds high
- flowering to veraison temps that are normal are 30-40 C.
- Inaki suggested looking at same temps but different amplitudes
- Amber suggested holding nighttime temp same but setting different maxes to get different means (I was less excited about this since climate change warms nights more than days)

Decision on stage to study and how:
- We will work on flowering (and maybe later we will work on veraison). 
- This will let us also answer questions about how flowering affects fruitset (so we must continue to monitor after treatments … in greenhouse? We did not discuss when the plants come out of the chambers).
- Plan to use priority varieties for flowering.
- Set in chamber at EL Stage 12 (even if it means an individual from one variety goes in ahead or after rest of variety individuals).
- EL stage 12 is 5 leaves separated

- Inaki suggested do some number of vars in all five chambers, add a few more vars that go in the two extreme temperature chambers so that we can do a species-level model.

- Possible MEAN temps: 20, 26, 30, 34, 38
- Inaki suggested we have a below optimum temp, an optimum temp and 3 above. He said models say optimum is around 28-30 … but we suspect 26-28 might be more realistic optimum maybe?


- Plan to sucker and prune to try to keep carbo load equivalent across varieties?? Need to ask Andy Walker too.

- Need protocol to COUNT flowers from camera; download ClimWine: J. Tardaguila, Spain, New plant phenotyping technologies in a changing climate, session 3-2. https://www6.inra.fr/laccave/ClimWine2016. Also he presented at GiESCO.

Random thoughts:
- Elisa recommends measuring plant height (stretch out plant and measure)
- Inaki recommends counting the number of leaves — phylocrhon (Iñaki can send refs) 
- Measure photosynthesis and respiration?
- Iñaki recommends doing 10 vars 
- Valla-aires (??) paper on WUE (can Iñaki send, Madroño & Flexas)

Varieties we have been focusing on in projections (and # we have for experiment):

Chasselas - 7
Chardonnay - 7
Pinot Noir - ?? (not sure what that means)
Sauvignon Blanc - 7 
Riesling - 0
Syrah - 8
Ugni blanc/Trebbiano - 4-5
Merlot - 6
Cabernet Sauvignon - 7
Grenache - 0
Mourvedre - 0
****************

Design:

36 plants fit in one regular chamber which is 19.8 or 20.4 ft of growth area (with one level of plants)
Walk in chamber has 38 ft, but remember to leave space to walk in and need to use it as a rep so best to plan on it being 20 ft too…

5 chambers (incl. room) 

So …. estimate 34 plants/chamber!

We don’t really have more than 8 reps for any one variety which limits how many reps of any actual treatment we could do.

Best idea (to me) is to aim for:
5 chambers - temps for each chamber:

30/25 C (same below)
30/25 C (same above)
34/29 C
38/33 C
44/39 C (aiming for super high, but maybe 42 would be better?)

For vars with 7-8 reps:
2 reps per variety per 3 main temps (30, 34, 38 C) and at least 1 rep at 44 C.
We can pick 34/2 (17) varieties for this treatment.

For vars with less reps:
We can pick an addition 12-14 varieties to put into the 30 C and 44 C chambers. 

Should we have a lower lowest temperature (25/20 C or something aiming for sort of ideal temp)?
How moist should we keep soils in chambers?
When should plants go into chambers? At a certain date or as each meets a certain phenological stage?

Vars for 4 treatments:

Barbera
Cabernet Sauvignon - 7
Cabernet franc
Chasselas doree - 7
Chardonnay - 7 (of which 2 are small)
Dolcetto
Durif (Petite Sirah)

Sangiovese (7 of which 1 is small)
Sauvignon Blanc - 7 
Syrah - 8
Szagos feher (7 of which 2 are small)
Schiopettino
Zinfandel/Primitivo (6 only)
