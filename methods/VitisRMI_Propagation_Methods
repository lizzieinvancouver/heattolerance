Methods and log for starting winegrape cuttings from Robert Mondavi Institute
teaching collection in December 2015. 
Started January 2016

Cuttings collection date: 18 December 2015

Method of collection: Cuttings were taken from the 2015 growth and two to three nodes were kept on each cutting (need to check on correct viticulture vocab here).

Chilling and propagation methods: Cuttings were placed in sealed, moist plastic bags and chilled in darkness for 21 days.

Then all cuttings were planted in trays with 1:1 perlite, potting soil mix, and placed in a greenhouse at 80 degrees C and ~50-60 % humidity for 7 days. A few began to break bud, so after 7 days, lowered the temperature to 60 degrees and placed the trays on heating mats at 80 degrees C. Plants were watered as needed to maintain soil moisture (we think they were overwatered!).    

After 15-16 days in the flats we observed yeast (potentially mold), removed plants from trays, power washed the yeast off and rinsed them in a 5% bleach solution followed by 3 rinsed in distilled water. In cases where there was no callous formation or root growth, a fresh cut was made. Then cuttings were placed in about 12 inch deep planting media (1:1 perlite, peat mix) that was just moistened in large plastic storage binds. These bins were covered in plastic bags and covered (in complete darkness), and then placed in a greenhouse at 85 degrees C and about 40-50 percent humidity.

Cultivating cuttings: Maintained Vitis cuttings 

26 January 2016 cuttings were cleaned and moved into closed large plastic storage bins. Cuttings were checked bi-weekly after that. 

Once rooting was observed, cuttings were moved into 1 gallon pots with a mix of 50% potting medium and 50% pine bark. All were potted up and kept in Weld Hill greenhouses in 16 hour day and 8 hour night conditions at 80 degrees F (26.7 C), at approx. 40% humidity.  Plants were watered three times per week, and fertilizer (check with Kea Woodruff) on fertilizer brand and exact amount. Sulphur was sprayed nightly between 3 and 6 am. All flowers were removed and plants were occasionally pruned to reduce vegetative growth, as they were quite vigorous.

Early May 2016: slow down growth with aim of getting plants closer to dormancy. Dropped temperature down to 70 initially, then down to 65 a week later (Kea will provide specific details). Also, shades were put up and day length reduced to 6 hours. 

Moved into cold chambers on 27 May 2016 to induce dormancy. Chambers are set (program called VITIS.DORM) to 6 C and 400 ppm light for 8 hours (day) then 4 C and no light for the other 16 hours. Humidity is set at 80%.

Leaf collections:
Two fully formed green leaves from the primary branch of each plant were removed and stored in a plastic bag with a wet paper towel for subsequent sampling of leaf dry matter content. 

Adding in seed protocol:

The cleaned and dried Vitis seeds were received, counted, and placed in cold stratification. 

Cold stratification:
Seeds were mixed into bags of moistened stratification mix (1/3 perlite, 1/3 sand, 1/3 sphagnum by volume). 
The bags were kept cold in the West Labs refridgerator for 61 days (from February 10th, 2016 until April 14th, 2016).  60 days was the minimum length given on our resource spreadsheet, lizzielist-working copy SM Sept 1 2014.xlsx (in google drive). 

Sowing:
The seeds were sown 1/4 inch deep, without removing them from their stratification mix, into 601 containers on April 14th, 2016. 
They were sown in fine-grained germination mix. (The orange bag of mix).
They were kept in a hot, humid germination greenhouse.

Potting up:
The seedlings were potted up starting on May 4, 2016, as well as on subsequent dates. Potting dates should be recorded on the tag for each seedling.
